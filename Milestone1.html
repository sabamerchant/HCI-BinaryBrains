            <h3>Problem Proposal:</h3>
            <p>
              Piazza is a learning management tool that allows students and
              teachers to communicate through a forum-type message board.
              Students often use this service to post questions, contribute to
              in-class discussions, and complete and/or upload assignments.
              They’re also able to access resources professors upload and
              communicate with the instructors privately. While the platform’s
              purpose is to create a centralized place for information and
              communication, the structure of the content and accessibility
              makes it difficult to navigate through the information. Altering
              the layout and sizing of the page will allow an easier experience
              for students to get the needed content therefore would be worth
              the change. The view of the website for teachers and for TAs is
              more effective for their use because they see a cleaner version of
              the messages that have been sent. The cleaner part of the
              TA/teacher’s view is that just the subject line is present for
              each message instead of the beginning of the message below the
              title.One potential factor that could affect the stakeholders is
              that the donation pop-up is not present in the cleaner
              teacher/TA’s view of the website while it is present in the more
              cluttered view of the website. Because Piazza allows for teachers
              to hold a platform for discussions and assignments for their
              students, the usability of the platform is crucial to establish
              effective discussions and grading for assignments. Therefore, a
              larger effect of this problem could be untimely grading and missed
              private and public discussions. Our group has identified several
              issues within the platform especially within the areas of
              readability and usability.

              In terms of readability, Piazza has several issues that affect the
              users ability to clearly understand what is being articulated due
              to issues such as reading the font size, understanding the unclear
              language, and organizing the text. For example, when the Piazza
              posts are presented on the sidebar, the body of the text is small
              and a light gray color, so seeing what is written could be hard
              for users who have impaired vision. Meanwhile at the bottom of the
              screen, there is a toolbar to help the user gauge activity for
              their course. The term “special mentions” is used for informing
              the user that they have been mentioned, but that language is
              unclear and not consistent with other forum-based platforms. The
              content organization is also inconsistent and confusing with
              private messages not being grouped together for users to read on
              direct threads that they have started/have been included in. It is
              not clear what messages have been read or not read, and the
              advertising of their mobile application version for the platform
              is ill-placed, causing most users to miss that fact.

              In terms of usability, Piazza has several issues that affect the
              experiences of those who use it (students, teachers, TAs, etc). A
              common theme throughout the design of the website is the icons are
              not matching their typical perceptions or purposes and are
              misleading the user. For example, the chat box icon in the toolbar
              leads a user to believe this is a way to create a post or
              privately message someone; however, it directs the user to a page
              dedicated to messages from companies and the user’s profile. This
              results in a frustrating experience for the student due to the
              misinterpretation of the button’s function. Another theme is that
              the website is misrepresenting the content and the buttons -
              chatting, posting, and reading. For example, the gear icon for
              settings exists twice on the page - both for different settings:
              account and class. Another usability related bug that Piazza has
              is that there is no discernable difference between
              unresolved/resolved threads. It makes it difficult to know the
              purpose of the types of thread, and when to use it. Most websites
              have their company logo reset all filters on the site and navigate
              you to the home page; however, Piazza takes the user to the home
              page but continues to filter through previous settings. This
              becomes a tedious task for the users to manually change the
              filters to their default settings. Lastly, when a feature is
              disabled, a student should be unaware of that feature to avoid
              confusion or clutter rather than seeing a button that does nothing
              but tell you the feature is disabled. This is shown with the
              statistics button in the toolbar next to classes, and takes away
              from the experience and adds to the clutter.

            <p>
              In terms of other factors that contribute to the problems
              aforementioned, one that contributes greatly to not being able to
              effectively use the website is learner self-efficacy and the
              students’ perception of the website. Those who use the website are
              left to figure out what the different features and functions are
              on their own, which can get confusing with the sheer amount of
              things that can be done on Piazza. In addition, for those who use
              the website and are not familiar with discussion-based forums,
              such as Edmodo, would find it difficult to grasp the usability of
              the website. Also, Piazza is a fully online platform which
              requires the internet. This means that those who do not have
              access to computers/technology and an internet connection would
              not be able to use it. Also, for class sizes that are particularly
              large with a disproportionate ratio of students to teachers, it
              can be difficult for the teachers to answer every single question
              and deal with repeated questions.
