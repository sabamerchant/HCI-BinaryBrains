            <h3>Research question:</h3>
            <p>Does the top toolbar of the Piazza website allow users to clearly identify and use features on Piazza?

              Based on the research question, our methodology will include mixed methods. We will use a combination of experiments and interviews 
              in order to answer the research question. We feel that a combination of an experiment and an interview would be the ideal methodology 
              because experiments allow us to analyze whether or not our improved toolbar has any effect on the participants. Experiments would allow
              us to use a controlled environment and view the interactions that the user would have with the interface. Having this first-hand knowledge
              of what the user clicks on and does to complete certain tasks would give us a better understanding of whether or not it is easy/fast to 
              find features on the Piazza website. Also, interviews allow us to further understand the actions of the participant and dig deeper into the 
              participant's thoughts and opinions regarding the interface. With interviews, we could ask direct questions to give us more insight about 
              how the user feels about the interface and the thought process behind their actions. We feel that a combination of these results would 
              allow us to draw conclusions about whether or not the toolbar allows users to clearly identify and use features on Piazza.
            </p>
            <h3>Brief Explanation of Methodology:</h3>
            <p>For our experiment, we plan to have three trials with two groups each. We will select our participants from a pool of random college 
              students and college professors that have never used Piazza before. We will then separate them into groups of five, and assign them to 
              either interact with the old interface (Group A) or the new interface (Group B). Because we are conducting three trials, we will have 
              thirty total participants with five people in Group A and five people in Group B per trial. In each trial, we will ask the participants 
              in each group to go to certain web pages within Piazza and record the amount of time it takes to get there, and the number of buttons they 
              click to get there. All of our studies will be focused on the toolbar located at the top of the Piazza webpage. We will ask the participants 
              to go to the following pages on Piazza:
              <ul>
                <li> Calendar</li>
                <li> Resources</li>
                <li> Networking Page</li>
              </ul>
              We will then record how many buttons they click to get to the right page, and how much time it takes for them to do this. We will do this 
              for each participant in each group for all three trials. For the purpose of this experiment, Group A participants will use the original Piazza 
              interface and the Group B participants will use our design prototype of the Piazza webpage. We will then conduct interviews with eac of the 
              participants, asking them a series of questions about their experience with the interface. Some of the questions we will ask include:
              <ul>
                <li> Did you find the Piazza Toolbar confusing when trying to find certain features, and if so, which features were difficult to find?
                </li>
                <li> Are there any features on the Piazza Website that looked misleading or confusing?
                </li>
                <li>  Do you think the Piazza Toolbar overall is straightforward in letting you know what features are available and how to get to them?
                </li>
                <li>  Was there anything in particular that you liked or disliked about the design of the Piazza Toolbar?
                </li>
              </ul>
              We will use the answers to these questions and any other information that the participants share with us as our qualitative data and use a combination
              of both the quantitative and qualitative data to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of our new prototype.
            </p>
            <h3>Testing Procedure:</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Informed Consent
                  <ul>In order to make sure that we are covering all the bases and being completely ethical in our experiment, we will be requiring that a participant
                    give voluntary consent in order to participate in the experiment. We will also make sure that they are informed about how the data from the experiment
                    is going to be used. All the information about how the data is going to be used and disclosure of anything about the experiment will be explained to 
                    the participants. We will also ensure that the participants comprehend what we are explaining to them, ensuring that everyone has adequate understanding 
                    of what they are agreeing to before they do. Participation will be voluntary, and the participants will always have the option to opt-out of the experiment 
                    at any point throughout the experimentation process. In order to ensure that this is done properly, we will use a packet of information regarding the experiment, 
                    and have each participant sign a statement confirming that they understand and voluntarily consent to participating in the experiment.                  
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Data Collection
                  <ul>
                    In terms of the data we will collect, we plan to collect a mix of qualitative and quantitative data. Most of the quantitative data will come from the experiment, while most of the qualitative data will come from the interviews following the experiments. The quantitative data we will collect will be the number of clicks/buttons the participant presses to get to each of the pages we ask them to. In addition, we will collect quantitative data about the amount of time it takes for the participant to get to each page we ask them to redirect to. The quantitative data we would collect would be through the interviews that we conduct following each trial. Information about these interviews can be found above in the experiment methodology, but will essentially be answers to a series of questions we will ask the participants about the interface.             
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Analysis of Data
                  <ul>In order to analyze the data we collect, we will compare the quantitative data from trials with Group A and trials with Group B. In doing this, we will be able to see which interface allows for the last effort and easiest execution of a given task. In addition, we will be able to see which interface is faster to use. We will also take into consideration the qualitative results in relation to each personâ€™s quantitative results, making sure we account for all possibilities. We will also weigh the qualitative data based on which comments were positive, which comments were negative, and which comments were indifferent about the interface design. We will use the comparison of performance from Group A and Group B to determine which interface is easier for the participants to navigate and more effective in carrying out the goal.
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Testing Procedure during a Pandemic
                  <ul>In order to make sure we are being safe during a pandemic, we will adhere to all of the Covid guidelines for the time of the experiment. We will also ensure that we sanitize any equipment in between uses and make sure that the testing and interview environment is clean. We will also make sure that anyone who is feeling sick (and is contagious) is not exposing anyone else. We will recommend that participants wear masks if they feel comfortable doing so and all the researchers and interviewers will be wearing masks regardless of whether or not they feel sick (unless there is a health issue present that prevents this).
