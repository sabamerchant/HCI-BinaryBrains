            <p>These are all user stories that are relevant to the proposed solution because these user stories all describe instances where students want to view or use features of the calendar on Piazza which is an element of the toolbar. By creating a more readable toolbar, the users will be able to understand all the features the calendar provides and navigate to it better.

              <h4>User Story 4:</h4>
              <p>As a student who uses Piazza, I want to go to the calendar so I can see the schedules of events that are occurring.</p>
              <p>As student who uses piazza, I want to be able to navigate to my calendar, so that I can view company recruitment events via piazza.</p>
              <p>Alt Design Idea: Have a tab that tells you the date/event you have</p>
              <p>Description & Justification: 
                In our problem of study, readability was a prevalent problem in the toolbar. The calendar icon was difficult to identify as the logo was not clear or distinguishable. Reasons for this are lack of contrast or unclear logo without description. To address the issue our user story prompts a clear need of “As a student who uses Piazza, I want to go to the calendar so I can see the schedules of events that are occurring.”  If the user would like to access the calendar, this design suggests to have a calendar drop down. The dropdown will have a hover feature to display clickibilty - signifying the ability to click. Once clicked, the drop down will appear in a widget like box. This drop down is meant to save space and allow the user to easily access the current day or following days events.
                
                Research shows the hover ability provides additional information for users and information about links to users before they click. It further allows them to use and understand the functionality, showing  users possibilities on a website before they commit to a specific action. Also research says, when it comes to unfamiliar items it’s better to visually expose the items instead of hiding them. It’s even better to do it in a logically organized way: create groups with meaningful titles, and let the users zoom in to the groups they are interested in.
                
                The hover feature displays the clickability of a button, in this case the envelope. This also should be enough to 
                signify to the user the affordance of the button is clicking.
