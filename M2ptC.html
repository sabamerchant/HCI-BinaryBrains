            <br/>
            <div>
                <h4 style= "color:#ffffffcc;">Propose a design solution to your problem:</h4>
                <br/>
                <p style="margin: left 1.5em;">
                  The user can change the color of the website and font color/size by clicking the settings button. After doing that, 
                  they are choosing their pairing of color palettes or size. This can mean the site turns darker or the font gets larger. 
                  The ability of changing the font color and size is a new proposed solution. After doing this, the user is expecting the 
                  changes to apply throughout the whole toolbar. The result of this action will change the toolbar color to be the color 
                  of choosing and also change the color of any default blue icons to the new chosen color as well. Additionally, the size 
                  of the font will also increase in proportion to their already existing size. For example, small could be a size 10 for a 
                  title and 5 for the paragraphs while a large could be 20 for a title and 10 for the paragraphs. Our solution of being 
                  consistent with the readability of the color contrasts is comparable to existing solutions. Other sites and systems that 
                  can be examples of this are dark and light modes of devices. The change of the dark or light theme is consistent throughout 
                  all parts of the system - in parallel we propose where the toolbar is our system be consistent with its displays.

                <h4 style= "color:#ffffffcc;">Measuring success:</h4>
                <p style="margin: left 1.5em;">
                  Measuring the success of this proposed solution can be done if the changes made to the toolbar are seen throughout the top 
                  of the site and have no confusion. The current way of changing the color theme is difficult to understand, so if users are 
                  able to navigate to changing the colors easier that would also be a good evaluation of success. The criterias we came up with 
                  are readability - how easy can the user read the bar, usability - how efficiently and easily the user can change color combinations 
                  and sizes, and consistency - does the user believe then changes are reflected throughout.
