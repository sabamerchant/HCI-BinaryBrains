                <p>Piazza is a learning management tool that allows students and teachers to communicate through a forum-type message board. Students often use this service to post questions, contribute to in-class discussions,
                    and complete and/or upload assignments. They’re also able to access resources professors upload and communicate with the instructors privately. While the platform’s purpose is to create a centralized place 
                    for information and communication, the structure of the content and accessibility makes it difficult to navigate through the information. The main problem we will be focusing on for the purpose of this project 
                    is the readability of the toolbar at the top of the Piazza website. The problems with the toolbar at the top of the Piazza website include violations of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the 
                    Section 508 Guidelines. For example, there are discrepancies in navigation for the website, the colors displayed, and the difficult identification of the interactive elements on the website. This is a problem 
                    specifically for those with disabilities such as dyslexia, Irlen Syndrome, light sensitivity, and autism because it does not allow for easy access for those who struggle with reading small text, can not differentiate 
                    between colors, and those who are sensitive to overstimulation. This is theme-relevant because Piazza is a tool that is used frequently in education at institutes of higher learning. An example of this is at the University 
                    of Georgia, where multiple computer science classes utilize Piazza for class-related content.

                <h4>7 Stages of Action Example:</h4>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold">Example:</span> An example of a goal in which the user would use the task bar of Piazza would be one where a UGA student enrolled in a class that uses Piazza wanted to change the color/theme of their Piazza page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold">Trigger:</span> The user is not able to see the text as well with the background color and notices that they can change the color/theme of their Piazza view, so they decide to change the color.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold">Goal: </span> The user wants to change the theme/color of their Piazza page to be a different color instead of the default blue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold">Execution: </span>
                        <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Plan: </span> The user sees the dropdown for the possibilities of colors that they can choose from and decide that they want. Their options are dark blue (default), purple, gray, dark green, yellow, light green, light blue, and pink.</p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Specify: </span> The user picks an option; in this case, they decide to choose purple because it allows more contrast and they would be able to see the text better. </p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Perform: </span>The user moves their mouse to select the purple option and clicks it so it turns the theme/color of the website to be purple. </p>
                </p>
                <p>    
                    <span style="font-weight:bold">World:</span> At this point, the theme/color of the website is purple and the user is done changing the colors on the website. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold">Evaluation:</span>
                        <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Perceive: </span>The user sees the purple toolbar at the top of the Piazza website now instead of the defaulted dark blue color that they saw before. </p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Interpret: </span>The user thinks to themselves that the new color of their toolbar looks great and that they can read the text on the top toolbar a lot better than when it was the defaulted blue. Although it doesn’t change the entire theme of the website and the rest of the blue buttons to purple, they are happy with the way that their toolbar looks now. </p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 2em;"><span style="font-weight:bold">Compare: </span>The user believes that they have met their goal, as they did not like the color of the toolbar at the top of the website. Now, the toolbar is a color that they like, so they have accomplished their goal. </p>
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h4>Potential Users:</h4>
                <p>
                  The potential users for this platform are students, teachers, and teaching assistants that go to university where Piazza is a learning tool that is used in the classes they are in/are teaching/are assisting. The user population that is affected by our problem of study is those with disabilities 
                  such as dyslexia, Irlen Syndrome, light sensitivity, and autism. This user population is affected because Piazza’s toolbar does not allow for easy access for those who struggle with reading small text, can not differentiate between colors, and those who are sensitive to overstimulation. Some 
                  related tasks that the users would perform would be changing things in their profile, their settings, searching for companies, viewing events, or accessing tabs for their classes. The users would benefit from a solution to this problem, as it would allow for them to be able to differentiate the 
                  colors and text much better, which would allow for better readability. This would help them to use the website more effectively and make use of all the features it provides without any discomfort.
