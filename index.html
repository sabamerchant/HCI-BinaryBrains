                  <h3>Problem Proposal:</h3>
                  <p>Piazza is a learning management tool that allows students and teachers to communicate through a forum-type message board. Students often use this service 
                    to post questions, contribute to in-class discussions, and complete and/or upload assignments. They’re also able to access resources professors upload and 
                    communicate with the instructors privately. While the platform’s purpose is to create a centralized place for information and communication, the structure 
                    of the content and accessibility makes it difficult to navigate through the information. The main problem we will be focusing on for the purpose of this 
                    project is the readability of the toolbar at the top of the Piazza website. The problems with the toolbar at the top of the Piazza website include violations
                    of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the Section 508 Guidelines. For example, there are discrepancies in navigation for the website, the colors 
                    displayed, and the difficult identification of the interactive elements on the website. This is a problem specifically for those with disabilities such as dyslexia, 
                    Irlen Syndrome, light sensitivity, and autism because it does not allow for easy access for those who struggle with reading small text, can not differentiate between 
                    colors, and those who are sensitive to overstimulation. This is theme-relevant because Piazza is a tool that is used frequently in education at institutes of higher 
                    learning. An example of this is at the University of Georgia, where multiple computer science classes utilize Piazza for class-related content.
