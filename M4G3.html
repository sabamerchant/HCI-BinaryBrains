              <h4>User Story 5:</h4>
              <p>As a student, I want to be able to access other resources that my professor has included through Piazza.</p>
              <p>Alt Design Idea: A pinned thread of all resources like a pinned discussion post.</p>
              <p>
                Description & Justification: 
                In our problem of study, readability was a prevalent problem in the toolbar. The resources tab is clear to see however, there are so many tabs and options to pick from on the toolbar. To combat this issue, we made the resources pop up as pinned on the left hand side to emphasize its importance and allow for easy readability.
                To address the issue our user story prompts a clear need of “As a student, I want to be able to access other resources that my professor has included through Piazza.” 

                The actions that lead the user to complete the story of wanting to access all of their resources we did through a tab labeled “Resources.” We chose to have the resulting page be
                similar to what Piazza does for normal discussions of having pinned (important) messages at the top and then all other messages at the bottom.
                This format of having a text-label button for Resources is widely used - an example would ELC. We thought this was the best design because it follows many guidelines of proper
                information order. For example, the pinned messages draw importance to what should be focused on resource wise. The same goes for the color contrast to indicate what page
                the user is on.

                Evidence

                Similar to how higher contrast colors attract user's attention, having a separate section in our page labeled “Pinned” draws users attention to know what that section signifies
                - important information they need.

                We chose to use a text label for Resources also because there was not a universal symbol or image that would symbolize “Resources.”  
                Despite the majority of the site keeping the discussion posts on the left toolbar, for this section, we chose to have all the messages on this page be for resources. This means 
                all the threads - pinned and normal - should be Resources. We picked this because users assume meaning based off of their context. Because the user selected the Resource 
                tab in the toolbar, the expectation would be the result would contain only resources.

              <h4>User Story 6:</h4>
              <p>As a student who uses Piazza for my classes, I want to be able to network with other companies, but I don't know where to go to do that.</p>
              <p>Alt Design Idea: Have a networking icon in the toolbar with a hover feature that displays the text "networking" when hovered.</p>
              <p>
                Description & Justification: 
                In our problem of study, usability was a prevalent problem in the toolbar. If someone wanted to network through Piazza it would be difficult to find where. There is a search companies
                tab in the toolbar, but it is not clear on whether one can network from there. So, that proposed a problem in usability as discussed in our proposal. To combat this issue, we made the 
                networks labeled tab in the toolbar which takes you to a page to network. To address the issue our user story prompts a clear need of “As a student who uses Piazza for my classes,
                I want to be able to network with other companies, but I don't know where to go to do that.” For the design we chose, the user experience goes as follows. The user sees the 
                networking icon of handshaking. When a user moves their cursor over that icon, they will see a 
                tooltip pop up that says networking. Once the user clicks the button, they will be taken to the networking page. We chose this design as our best one because it was a simple 
                solution that worked well.
                Evidence:

                When picking icons, there usually is a sense of familiarity. The handshake symbol is known world wide to be a way of “sealing the deal” or a sign of respect  
                This goes in hand with networking and business. That is the reason we chose to use the handshaking icon to represent networking.

                Tooltips show up when a user hovers over a specific part of a page and extra information is displayed. We chose this design because the icon keeps the UI easy to read while 
                the tooltip provides clarification if the user is unsure what the icon does.
