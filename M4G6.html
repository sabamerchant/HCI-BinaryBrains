              <h4>User Story 8:</h4>
              <p>As a student who uses Piazza, I want to be able to see what companies are interested in me so that I can advance my career</p>
              <p>Alt Design Idea:
                Have a networking icon in the toolbar that displays companies interested in you when double click on option in a dropdown.</p>
              <p>
                Description & Justification: 
                We chose to remove this from our final prototyping due to a duplicate design with another Networking search - Networking DD Flow. We believed the other Company Prototype 
                was more consistent with the rest of our work. According to Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules, we are following the rule of striving for consistency.

                In our problem of study, usability was a prevalent problem in the toolbar. If someone wanted to network through Piazza it would be difficult to find where. There is a search companies
                tab in the toolbar, but it is not clear on whether one can network from there. So, that proposed a problem in usability as discussed in our proposal. To combat this issue, we made the 
                networks labeled tab in the toolbar which takes you to a page to network when clicking on an option in the dropdown. To address the issue our user story prompts a clear need of “As a student who uses Piazza, I want
                to be able to see what companies are interested in me so that I can advance my career.” As a student who uses Piazza for my classes, I want to be able to view my inbox and see the messages I have recieved from companies.
                With this user story, the goal is to be able to see what companies are interested in the user. Our design idea is to keep the networking icon on the toolbar with a drop down. The pointer on the browser will change to a cursor to indicate the icon can 
                be selected. When the drop down is clicked, the companies that are interested in the user will show up. The user can select whichever company they prefer and go to that page. We chose this becasue it enables the site to keep a clear view 
                of the networking tab, and also allowing easy access through a dropdown for the user. 


                Our first decision of having the pointer change to a cursor is due to this article: https://uxdesign.cc/missing-the-pointer-1dfc5cd60c8c - where it discusses the affordance of clicking the icon.

                Research shows the hover ability provides additional information for users and information about links to users before they click. It further allows them to use and understand the functionality, showing  users possibilities on a website before they 
                commit to a specific action. Also reasearch says, when it comes to unfamiliar items it's better to visually expose the items instead of hiding them. It’s even better 
                to do it in a logically organized way: create groups with meaningful titles, and let the users zoom in to the groups they are interested in.

                The hover feature displays the clickability of a button, in this case the envelope. This also should be enough to signify to the user the affordance of the button is clicking.

              <h4>User Story 13:</h4>
              <p>As an instructor or student, I want to be able to change/enter my different classes so that I can see different classes information.</p>
              <p>Alt Design Idea:
                Have a filter/checkbox system to select classes/pages to show what should be shown/hidden.</p>
              <p>
                Description & Justification: 
                We chose to remove this from our final prototyping due to a duplicate design with another Page option. We believed the other Company Prototype 
                was more consistent with the rest of our work. According to Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules, we are following the rule of striving for consistency.
                In this side by side frame comparison, we depict a frame where the pages tab is available for users to hover over. In the second frame to the right, we depict a view of Piazza where the pages tab is hovered over, we are able to see the different pages. We felt that the hover item would provide quick access and easier understanding for users to click on check boxes which page(s) they would like to see (ex: viewing either classes and/or the calander in their main content container). We also hoped this quick accessibility would afford more readability to select which page(s) you want to see information for.

                To justify adding the ability to hover, the hover ability triggers a user to that there is an option for action, as discusses in the Baynard Institute article. In the Medium Article, the author concludes that the dropdown multiselect option allows users to “zoom into” topics they are interested in. Emphasizing our design choice, since we are aiming to enable them to choose what they would like to view. This same research article states that multi-select dropdown menu helps when it comes to unfamiliar items, because it visually exposes the items instead of hiding them to users. 

                We chose this idea as our high fidelity one because the research we found indicated that this option was the better one in terms of user experience.
